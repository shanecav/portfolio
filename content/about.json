  "I'm a full stack developer and designer with nine years of professional experience. I'm currently working with a small team building blockpop, a geo-based event & nightlife discovery app. In addition, I do contract and sub-contract work for various organizations and agencies.",
  "I currently specialize in front end development with React, Redux, and their surrounding ecosystems, but I'm comfortable writing clean, maintainable, performant JavaScript in any setting. I'm experienced with modern JavaScript toolchains & workflows, and use Webpack, Babel (ES6/ES7), Flow, and git on a regular basis. I practice Test-Driven Development, and have experience using mocha, tape, Jest, nyc, enzyme, chai, and sinon.",
  "In addition to front end development, I have experience building back end interfaces with Node.js and PHP. I've built APIs that utilize both REST and WebSockets. I have experience with SQL databases (PostgreSQL and MySQL), object databases (MongoDB, CouchDB, and RethinkDB), and Redis."
