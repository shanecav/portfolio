## Hi,

This is the repo for my portfolio site at [shanecavaliere.com](http://shanecavaliere.com). It's built with React, Redux, and a bunch of other great libraries.

#### _Wait, this code seems really complex for a simple portfolio site..._

It is! I wanted the chance to showcase some application-type code, since I can't share source code from my commercial projects. I built this site with similar tools and structure that I use on applications. Rest assured that I wouldn't add complexity to a project for no reason - I'm a big fan of simplicity.
