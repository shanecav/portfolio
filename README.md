## Hi,

This is the repo for my portfolio site at [shanecavaliere.com](http://shanecavaliere.com). It's built with React, Redux, and a few other great libraries. The site's content comes from Firebase, via a library I wrote called [firebase-react](https://github.com/shanecav/firebase-react).

#### _This seems kind of complex for a simple portfolio site..._

I certainly could have built a static site with simpler code, and achieved better load times. However, I wanted the chance to showcase some more application-type code since I can't publicly share source code from the commercial projects that occupy most of my time (and I also just love working with React), so I built this site with similar tools and structure that I use on applications. Rest assured that I wouldn't add complexity to a project for no reason - I'm a big fan of simplicity.
