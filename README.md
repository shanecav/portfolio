## Hi,

This is the repo for my portfolio site at [shanecavaliere.com](http://shanecavaliere.com). It's built with React, Redux, and a few other great libraries. The site's content comes from Firebase, via a library I wrote called [firebase-react](https://github.com/shanecav/firebase-react).

#### _This seems kind of complex for a simple portfolio site..._

It is! But what can I say, I love building stuff with React.
